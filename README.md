# Competititve Coding Example Testcase

## Introduction

This repository provides a comprehensive, real-world example of a competitive programming problem suite, designed for organizations seeking to train and evaluate AI models on advanced algorithmic tasks. It includes problem statements, validators, checkers, a diverse set of correct and incorrect solutions, and a rich collection of test cases—mirroring the rigorous standards used in major programming competitions.

Our approach, already trusted by leading AI research teams, enables robust benchmarking and fine-tuning of models for code generation, problem-solving, and test case reasoning. The structure and assets in this repo are crafted to facilitate automated evaluation pipelines, large-scale model training, and in-depth analysis of model performance on challenging, domain-specific tasks.


## Directory Structure

- `./standard.cpp` - Reference solution for the problem.
- `./test_cases/` - Contains `.in` (input) and `.out` (expected output) files for each test case.
- `./Correct/` - Directory of solutions that pass the test case
- `./InCorrect/` - Directory of incorrect solutions (fail 1 or more test cases) used for preference ranking
- `./validator.cpp` - problem-specific input validator for test cases
- `./checker.cpp` - validates output generated by solutions
- `./generator.cpp` - Generates test cases
- `./requirements.json` - metadata for the task
- `./run_all.sh` - Script to run all solutions against all test cases


## Problem Statement for "Valid Subsets"
You are given an array $a$ of $n$ integers (1-indexed). You need to process $q$ independent queries.
In each query, you are given three integers $l$, $r$, and $x$, and your task is to count the number of **non-empty subsets** of the subarray $a[l..r]$ such that **for every pair of elements** in the chosen subset, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the pair is **not divisible by $x$**.

Since the answer can be very large, **output it modulo** $998244353$.

## Constraints
- $1 \leq n, q \leq 10^5$  
- $1 \leq a_i, x \leq 10^5$  
- $1 \leq l \leq r \leq n$  

- Time limit per test: 2 seconds  
- Memory limit per test: 512 megabytes

## Input

- The first line contains an integer $n$ — the size of the array.  
- The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ — the elements of the array.  
- The third line contains an integer $q$ — the number of queries.  
- The next $q$ lines each contain three integers $l$, $r$, and $x$ — describing a query.

## Output

For each query, output a single integer — the number of valid non-empty subsets of the subarray $a[l..r]$ such that no pair of elements has GCD divisible by $x$. Output each result modulo $998244353$.

## Notes

- A subset can contain any number of elements from $a[l..r]$, as long as it is non-empty.
- A subset is valid if **for every pair** $(a_i, a_j)$ in the subset, $\gcd(a_i, a_j)$ is **not divisible** by $x$.
- Single-element subsets are always valid.

## Sample Input

5  
2 3 4 5 6  
3  
1 3 2  
2 5 3  
1 5 5  

## Sample Output

3  
7  
15  

## Explanation

Consider the queries one by one:

1. Query $(l=1, r=3, x=2)$ — subarray is $[2, 3, 4]$  
   Valid subsets (non-empty) where no pair's GCD is divisible by $2$ are:  
   - $\{2\}$  
   - $\{3\}$  
   - $\{4\}$  
   The subsets with more than one element, such as $\{2,4\}$, are invalid because $\gcd(2,4) = 2$ is divisible by $2$.  
   Hence total valid subsets: $3$.

2. Query $(l=2, r=5, x=3)$ — subarray $[3, 4, 5, 6]$  
   The total valid subsets count is $7$.

3. Query $(l=1, r=5, x=5)$ — subarray $[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]$  
   The total valid subsets count is $15$.
